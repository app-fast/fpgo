* Original net/http implementation - https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-09/https-proxy-in-golang-in-less-than-100-lines-of-code/
* Inspired by [goproxy](https://github.com/snail007/goproxy) - Closed-source (only very few lines of code are open-source) multi-purpose proxy. TBH this one seems to be unstable in heavy traffic that's why I made fpgo üíêüíê
